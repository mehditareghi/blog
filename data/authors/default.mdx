I’m a Software Engineer focused on building user-centered, high-performing web applications. With skills in Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, I work to deliver solutions that enhance user experience and meet business goals.

Throughout my career, I’ve led projects that transformed websites, migrating them to modern frameworks for better speed, SEO, and retention. My experience includes creating multilingual sites, developing dashboards, and implementing scalable architectures.

I’m also passionate about sharing knowledge. I’ve created courses on JavaScript and HTML/CSS, helping hundreds of learners. Every day, I aim to grow, explore new tech, and contribute to the web development community.
